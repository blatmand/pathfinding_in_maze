## Pathfinding in 2 dimensional mazes

## Problem description
Goal: deciding whether there is a connection between a
starting and an ending cell in a square 2 dimensional maze.

Can move in the maze in 4
direction:
Horizontally to the left or
right
Vertically up or down
Cannot move diagonally
Cannot move through walls
(blue)
Cannot move outside the
maze

## Recursive search algorithm

Algorithm uses recursion such that each cell in the maze
delegates the question of connectivity to itâ€™s neighbors (if they
exist) unless the cell itself is the target or has already been
visited
Overall algorithm walks through the maze and avoids walls
and already visited cells.
Pro: algorithm is relatively easy to understand and implement
Returns True or False depending on whether there exists a
path to the target cell
Drawback: does not give the shortest path between the target
and initial cell. For this task there exists e.g. an algorithm
called A*.
